**Resources**

Monte Carlo ({{% resource_link 97bb611e-6428-c4e1-92a9-dd17383c4a4d "PDF" %}})

Matlab Tutorial ({{% resource_link b398f041-94a7-9035-376f-ec05b2d20c5f "PDF" %}})

### *PCR simulator*

pcr\_sim.m ({{% resource_link "92dc62aa-4242-497b-8392-d6681f508b4b" "M" %}})  
Replicate a certain number of starting copies of DNA for several cycles. Try different probabilities of replication to get different histograms showing how much DNA is produced over many trials.

pcr\_sim.fig ({{% resource_link "7b17c7e9-7cd9-4e4d-9f0c-d78c4c5cb39d" "FIG" %}})  
Put this in the same directory as pcr\_sim.m to be able to run "pcr\_sim" from the matlab prompt.

Random Walk - 2D with 2 Particles ({{% resource_link "3d1a7be4-405b-4994-bacf-a0877a0c7d80" "M" %}})  
Look at how these simulations work and try making your own 3D random walk or have your particle trace out a trajectory in Matlab.
